# CustomerOverview  
  
## Introduction  
  
This Android application was created as a running project for the User Interfaces 2 course at the Karel de Grote University College. It is used throughout the course to implement and exercise acquired skills. It will be continually expanded throughout the semester.  
  
## Technology  
Following requirements were mandatory to get a passing grade:
* Support for API level 21 and above
* Use of AndroidX artifacts
* Use of Kotlin programming language, no Java code allowed.
## Getting started
Since most of the app relies on REST calls to a web server, it is necessary to do some setup. We suppose you're running the app from the standard emulator and the node package json-server is running at localhost:3000. The json file that has to be served can be found under resources/raw/customers.json.
